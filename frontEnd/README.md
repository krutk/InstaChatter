# InstaChatter - Chat Application

This project is a simple chat application built using Node.js for serverside and React.js for client that allows users to exchange messages in real-time. It also implements browser notifications to alert users about new messages, even when they are not actively using the chat.

## Features

- User Registration and Chat:

  - Users can join the chat by entering their details.
  - They can engage in both group chats (chatting with multiple users) and one-to-one chats (private conversations).

- Real-time Messaging:

  - Messages sent by users are instantly visible to all participants, ensuring no delays in communication.

- Browser Notifications:
  - Browser notifications are used to alert users about new messages, even if they're not currently using the chat.
  - Clicking on a notification takes users directly to the chat, where they can immediately respond.
